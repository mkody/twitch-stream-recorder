  # I'd recommend to remove the "=" and values after CLIENT_ID, CLIENT_SECRET
  # and AUTH_TOKEN and set them in a `.env` file instead.

  # If you want to run it for multiple streamers:
  # - duplicate the whole "tsr" section
  # - change the "twitch-stream-recorder" service name to something else
  #   (ie. `tsr-bobross`) as they have to be unique
  # - and set the new username in the `USERNAME` env
